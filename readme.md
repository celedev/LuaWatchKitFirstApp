# LuaWatchKitFirstApp

LuaWatchKitFirstApp is a very simple Watch app, using WatchKit and live-coded in Lua with CodeFlow. It presents a gallery of characters in which you can navigate with two buttons, *Next* and *Previous*. Tapping on the character's picture navigates to a detail screen, and a contextual menu on the main screen gives access to page-navigation-organized modal controllers that illustrate the use of maps and image animation.

LuaWatchKitFirstApp shows, on the Objective-C side, how to use a Lua Context for live-coding an iOS or OS X app extension. On the Lua side, all code and image resources can be dynamically changed and the changes are immediately visible on the Watch screen.

## Configuration required

A Mac with Celedev CodeFlow version 0.9.11 or later.

Works on the iOS simulator running iOS 8.2 beta 3 or later (included in Xcode 6.2 beta 3).

## How to use this code sample

1. Open the CodeFlow project for this sample application.  
  This will automatically update the associated Xcode project, so that paths and other build settings are correctly set for your environment.

2. Open the associated Xcode project. You can do this in CodeFlow with the menu command `Program -> Open Xcode Project`.

3. Run the application on a device or in the simulator.

4. In CodeFlow, select the application in the `Target` popup menu in the project window toolbar. The app stops on a breakpoint at the first line of the Lua program.

5. Click on the `Continue` button in the toolbar (or use the CodeFlow debugger for stepping in the program) 

6. Enjoy the power of live coding with CodeFlow

## Troubleshooting

- **The application crashes when creating the Lua Context (SIGKILL)**
  
  **What happens**: In Xcode 6.2 beta 5, the simulator apparently kills the app WatchKit extension if it takes too much time to start. And because the  Lua Context stops on an initial breakpoint when it connects to CodeFlow, the WatchKit extension timeout is exceeded and the extension is killed.
  
  **⇒ Fix**: Recent versions of Xcode 6.2 or Xcode 6.3 do not seem to have this problem. But if you encounter it in your environment, a workaround is to disable breakpoints in the CodeFlow project before starting the WatchKit app in Xcode.  Once the Watch app is started, you can safely re-enable breakpoints and debug your app.
  
- **Some libraries / header files in the sample app Xcode project are missing**

  **⇒ Fix**: open the corresponding CodeFlow project, and CodeFlow will update the associated Xcode project, so that paths and libraries are correctly set.

- **Link errors (missing symbols) occur when I compile the Xcode project**

  **Most probable cause**: if you are using an Xcode version older than 6.2, these errors occur because the sample app is configured for the iOS 8.2 SDK.

  **⇒ Fix**: Open the associated Xcode project form CodeFlow (*Program* menu or shortcut ⌘⇧O) and it will automatically be opened with the right Xcode version.
